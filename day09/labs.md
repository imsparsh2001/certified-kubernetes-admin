## Task 14/40

In this exercise, you will explore Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes

### Task details
- Taint both of your worker nodes as below

   worker01--> gpu=true:NoSchedule , worker02--> gpu=false:NoSchedule
- Create a new pod with the image nginx and see why it's not getting scheduled on worker nodes and control plane nodes.
- Create a toleration on the pod gpu=true:NoSchedule to match with the taint on worker01
- The pod should be scheduled now on worker01
- Delete the taint on the control plane node
- Create a new pod with the image redis , it should be scheduled on control plane node
- Add the taint back on the control plane node(the one that was removed)
