## Task 


In this exercise, you will create a Deployment with multiple replicas. After inspecting the Deployment, you will update its Pod template. You will also be able to use the rollout history to roll back to a previous revision.



## Replicaset
- Create a new Replicaset based on the nginx image with 3 replicas
- Update the replicas to 4 from the YAML
- Update the replicas to 6 from the command line

## Deployment
1. Create a Deployment named `nginx` with 3 replicas. The Pods should use the `nginx:1.23.0` image and the name `nginx`. The Deployment uses the label `tier=backend`. The Pod template should use the label `app=v1`.
2. List the Deployment and ensure the correct number of replicas is running.
3. Update the image to `nginx:1.23.4`.
4. Verify that the change has been rolled out to all replicas.
5. Assign the change cause "Pick up patch version" to the revision.
6. Scale the Deployment to 5 replicas.
7. Have a look at the Deployment rollout history.
8. Revert the Deployment to revision 1.
9. Ensure that the Pods use the image `nginx:1.23.0`.

## Troubleshooting the issue
1. Apply the below YAML and fix the issue with it

``` YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind:  Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
  labels:
    env: demo
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        env: demo
      name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: demo
```
